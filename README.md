### How to integrate an external metrics tool on Codacy

By creating a docker and writing code to handle the tool invocation and output,
you can integrate the tool of your choice on Codacy!

> To know more about dockers, and how to write a docker file please refer to [https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/](https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/)

In this tutorial, we explain how you can integrate a metrics tool of your choice in Codacy.
You can check the code of an already implemented tool and if you wish fork it to start your own.
You are free to modify and use it for your own tools.

#### Requirements

* Docker definition with the tool you want to integrate

#### Assumptions and Behaviour

* To run the tool we provide the configuration file, `/.codacyrc`, with the language to run and optional parameters your tool might need.
* The source code to be analysed will be located in `/src`, meaning that when provided in the configuration, the file paths are relative to `/src`.

* **.codacyrc**
  * **files:** Files to be analysed (their path is relative to `/src`)
  * **language:** Language to run the tool

```json
{
  "files" : [ "foo/bar/baz.scala", "foo2/bar/baz.scala" ],
  "language": "Scala"
}
```

* The exit codes can be different, depending if the tool invocation is successful or not:
  * :tada: **0**: The tool executed successfully
  * :cold_sweat: **1**: An unknown error occurred while running the tool
  * :alarm_clock: **2**: Execution timeout

** Notes: **

* To run the tool in debug mode, so you can have more detailed logs, you need to set the environment variable `DEBUG` to `true` when invoking the docker.
* To configure a different timeout for the tool, you have to set the environment variable `TIMEOUT` when invoking the docker, setting it with values like `10seconds`, `30minutes` or `2hours`.

#### Output

You are free to write the code running inside the docker in the language you prefer.
After you have your results from the tool, you should print them to the standard output in our **Result** format, one result per line.

```json
{
  "filename": "path/to/my/file1.scala",
  "complexity": 1,
  "loc": 300,
  "cloc": 320,
  "nrMethods": 20,
  "nrClasses": 2,
  "lineComplexities": [
    {
      "line": 2,
      "value": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

> The filename should not include the prefix `/src/`, the absolute path `/src/folder/file.js` should be returned as `folder/file.js`.

#### Submit the Docker

** Running the docker **

```sh
docker run -t \
    --net=none \
    --privileged=false \
    --cap-drop=ALL \
    --user=docker \
    --rm=true \
    -v <PATH-TO-FOLDER-WITH-FILES-TO-CHECK>:/src \
    -v <PATH-TO-CODACY-CONFIG-RC>:/.codacyrc \
    <YOUR-DOCKER-NAME>:<YOUR-DOCKER-VERSION>
```

** Docker restrictions **

    * Docker image size should not exceed 500MB
    * Docker should contain a non-root user named docker with UID/GID 2004
    * All the source code of the docker must be public
    * The docker base must officially supported on DockerHub
    * Your docker must be provided in a repository through a public git host (ex: GitHub, Bitbucket, ...)

** Docker submission **

    * To submit the docker you should send an email to `team [at] codacy [dot] com` with the link to the git repository with your docker definition.
    * The docker will then be subjected to a review by our team and you will then be contacted with more details

If you have any question or suggestion regarding this guide let us know.
